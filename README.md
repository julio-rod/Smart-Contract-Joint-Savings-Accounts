# Smart Contract Joint Savings Accounts
This project involves using remix and solidity to create a smart contract joint savings account to deposit and withdraw funds from a virtual environment.

# Structure
The smart contract should contain the following:
- Variables for account addresses, last withdrawl amount, contract balance, and last account to withdraw.
- Functions for withdraw, deposit, and setting accounts.
- A Fallback Function for handling unexpected inputs. 

# Technologies
This project utilizes the following:
- [Solidity ^0.5.0](https://soliditylang.org/)
- [Remix IDE](Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICAAQigUQkQIyCAgAEIoFEJECMggIABCKBRCRAjIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQ6BwgjELADECc6CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6CggAEIoFELADEENKBAhBGABQoBxYoBxgiUZoAXABeACAAYQCiAGEApIBAzItMZgBAKABAcgBCsABAQ)
- Remix VM - Mainnet fork

# Installation 
1. Install [Remix IDE]() or access it through the web browser.
2. Clone the project repository locally.
3. Load the `joint_savings.sol` contract in the Remix IDE.
4. Compile the contract using the Remix IDE's Solidity compiler. 
5. Deploy the contract using Remix VM - Mainnet fork.

# Steps
1. Create a Solidity contract named JointSavings.
2. Compile the contract using the JavaScript VM in the Remix IDE.
3. Deploy the contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
4. Interact with the contract by setting accounts, depositing ether, and withdrawing ether.
